# Async-Sendgrid

Sendgrid simple asynchronous client based on the httpx libarary.

# Installation

It is possible to install async-sendgrid with pip:

```bash
pip install async-sendgrid
```

# Usage
This is a small script showing how to send an email with async-sendgrid:

First, you need to import the ```SendgridAPI``` from the ```async_sendgrid``` package. Then, you need to create a ```SendgridAPI``` object with your API key.

```python
from async_sendgrid import SendgridAPI
import os

API_KEY = os.environ.get['API_KEY']
sendgrid = SendgridAPI(API_KEY)
```

Thereafter, you can create an email with the original ```sendgrid``` package such:

```python
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Content, Email, Mail, To

from_email = Email("test@example.com")
to_email = To("test@example.com")
subject = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit"
content = Content("text/plain", "Sed varius ligula ac urna vehicula ultrices. Nunc ut dolor sem.")

mail = Mail(
    from_email=from_email,
    to_email=to_email,
    subject=subject,
    content=content
    )

```

Finally you can send the email with the ```send``` method of the ```SendgridAPI``` instance:

```python
async with sendgrid as client:
    response = await client.send(data)
```
